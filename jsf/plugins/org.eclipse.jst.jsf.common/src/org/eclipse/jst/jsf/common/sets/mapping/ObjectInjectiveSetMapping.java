/**
 * A type of axiomatic set mapping that operates injectively on the output
 * set to create its result set.  Note that the injection (one-to-oneness)
 * of the mapping is based on Java objects and not on the value of the object.
 * Therefore, the result set is not guaranteed to be injective on the basis
 * of value.
 * 
 * For example, consider a set of integers:
 * 
 * X = {new Integer(4), new Integer(6), new Integer(9)}
 * 
 * an ObjectInjectiveSetMapping may be defined that maps this set
 * to a result based on:
 * 
 * map(x) = new Boolean(x < 8) for all x in X
 * 
 * An ObjectiveInjectiveSetMapping result set would look like this:
 * 
 * map(X) = {new Boolean(true), new Boolean(true), new Boolean(false)}
 * 
 * Note that boolean TRUE maps twice, so based on the value of the set members,
 * the mapping is not injective.  However, each Java object in X maps to a
 * distinct Java object in map(X)
 * 
 * This interface should not be implemented by clients. Clients should
 * sub-class AbstractObjectInjectiveSetMapping to avoid future API breakage.
